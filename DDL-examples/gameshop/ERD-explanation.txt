Quick explanation of the gameshop database diagram using crows foot notation.

Crows foot notation- In crowâ€™s foot notation, an entity is represented by a rectangle, with its name on the top. The name is singular (entity) rather than plural (entities). An attribute is a property that describes a particular entity. The attribute (s) that uniquely distinguishes an instance of the entity is the identifier. 

In the customers table the primary key customer_id has a 1 to many relationship with the orders table foreign key customer_id. This is because the customer can have multiple orders.

In the products table the primary key product_id has a many to many relationship with the orders table foreign key product_id. This is because there can be more than one of the same product sharing the same id.
